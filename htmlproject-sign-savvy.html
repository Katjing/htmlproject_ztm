    <td>Cancer</td>
    <td>This sensitive water sign needs to feel supported in work. Imagination will come in handy for designing websites and Cancer will have the best feeling of what the end user needs in web apps.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Leo</td>
    <td>Here is a leader. Not necessarily in real life, but in his own kingdom. This playful sign will try to make his worth show at work, and will need to have a say in projects. Best suited for broad tasks that he can put his name on, like an artist.</td>

  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Sagittarius</td>
    <td>Freedom loving and jovial. A fun colleague that can talk his way out of anything. Well suited for fullstack dev, espsially remotely, but maybe more playful og meaningful apps will be best for him, like quality games with some philosophic og historic relevance.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Capricorn</td>
    <td>The serious sign with great timing in humour. backend programming is great for her, but may aspire to let the public get to know her somehow. As a career-oriented sign, she may advance to company leader some day.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Aquarius</td>
    <td>Does it all with a natural reassuring and authentic no-bullshit intelligence. As a cool excentric he knows how good he is, and will do his best to always be better. Like Mozart he can take something advanced and make it simple for others. Best suited for fullstack dev. </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Pisces</td>
    <td>Imaginative and sensitive. Best suited for remote freelance work, as the waves of uncertainty and misguidance is always near. Will feel trapped in a 9-5 job. Best suited for graphical frontend work or maybe cybersecurity.</td>
