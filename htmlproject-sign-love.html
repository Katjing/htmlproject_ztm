<hr>
<p><strong>ARIES</strong><br> Bold and confident, as Aries are, you will never be bored or feel alone, but you may feel overlooked, as this sign is selfcentered and strongwilled, but that is what makes Aries so attractive. When they have served themselves they are the most authentic partners, that you always can rely on telling the truth.
<p><strong>TAURUS</strong></p> Sensual and loyal here's a steady partner that will go to great length with you. There will always be enough money and comfort and even affection. But don't cross this guy, for he will whirl up dirt and make you regret if you push him to far.
<p><strong>GEMINI</strong></p> Always on the go, here's a restless one you never get bored with. Maybe and inconvenience for more cuddly types. This air sign always has ideas and wants to discuss even small things. A great friend and companion you can always come to.
<p><strong>CANCER</strong></p> The mother of all signs. No one is more protective and empathic than this one, so rest assured that no matter how hard your day was, you will always come home to a hug and a great meal. Children is almost always a must, and at least two.
<p><strong>LEO</strong></p> The playboy is in the house! Althogh not necessarily promiscious this sign is eros in person, always flirting and making herself seen. Later in life you will have a very romantic and loyal partner, but she demands sincerity and respect!
<p><strong>VIRGO</strong></p> The servant of all servants. He will pay great attention to detail and of your needs, but will do that in everything, as he is a perfectionist that can sport a hair under the coach a mile away! Always clean and sober, this is a guy you can trust and have good conversations with.
<p><strong>LIBRA</strong></p> She is the afrodite of signs and will do a lot out of her appearance, some times too much, so she can't find anything to put on, even though her wardrobe is bulging! Also a romantic she doesn't care to much where you take her to, as long as there is nice surroundings and you behave like a gentleman.
<p><strong>SCORPIO</strong></p> Deep conversations over morning coffee coming up. This sign is in the mood for intense discussions always and develop deep feelings. He can be jealous and mean when you really hurt him. He will forgive but never forget, but no one feels so deeply as him.
<p><strong>SAGITTARIUS</strong></p> Fun loving and travel sick, if not in the world then in his mind. Put on your skis and move it or loose it sister. Will feel trapped at home if not given enough space or room for exploration, either of mind or with hobbies in or out of the house, as he always has something new thing brewing.
<p><strong>CAPRICORN</strong></p> She is the most serious and traditional lover of all the signs and will marry you if you propose. She will fancy material things as much as high morals, and probably will have both. Needs to learn how to laugh at herself and not take life so seriously.
<p><strong>AQUARIUS</strong></p> The exentric partner that demands authenticity and realism. He can play along in almost anything and will go to great lengths in relationships, even to the extend of losing himself or at least changing himself. Also your best friend in any way.
<p><strong>PISCES</strong></p> A romantic with rose-colored glasses that at least once in life has a crush on someone that is so unrealistic that she will be hurt in the end. That is because of the inclination to fantasize about others to make them fit their fairytale. Besides that you will never feel as loved by anyone more than you do by this sign.
